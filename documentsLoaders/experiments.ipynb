       "['Long years ago we made a tryst with destiny, and now the time comes when we shall redeem our pledge, not wholly or in full measure, but very substantially.\\n\\nAt the stroke of the midnight hour, when the world sleeps, India will awake to life and freedom. A moment comes, which comes but rarely in history, when we step out from the old to the new, when an age ends, and when the soul of a nation, long suppressed, finds utterance.\\n\\nIt is fitting that at this solemn moment we take the pledge of dedication to the service of India and her people and to the still larger cause of humanity.\\n\\nThe ambition of the greatest man of our generation has been to wipe every tear from every eye. That may be beyond us, but as long as there are tears and suffering, so long our work will not be over.\\n\\nAnd so we have to labor and to work, and work hard, to give reality to our dreams. Those dreams are for India, but they are also for the world.']"
